# Satellite Image Analysis for Environmental Change Detection

## Overview

This project aims to leverage Python, OpenCV, and NumPy to analyze satellite images and detect changes in specific areas over a given time period. The goal is to automate the process of environmental monitoring using satellite imagery, focusing on changes such as deforestation, urbanization, and coastal erosion.

## Project Proposal

### Introduction

The use of satellite imagery has become crucial in monitoring environmental changes. However, manual methods of analyzing these images are time-consuming and error-prone. This project addresses the need for automated, efficient, and accurate image processing techniques that can handle large datasets and detect significant changes in the Earth's surface.

The project employs Python libraries such as OpenCV and NumPy to preprocess satellite images and apply change detection algorithms. The developed framework will be validated against ground truth data to ensure accuracy and reliability.

### Objectives

- **Preprocessing:** Develop algorithms to preprocess satellite images (image enhancement, noise reduction, and geometric correction).
- **Change Detection:** Implement change detection algorithms to identify alterations in specific areas of interest.
- **User Interface:** Create a user-friendly interface for visualizing and interpreting results.
- **Validation:** Compare results with ground truth data and existing techniques to ensure accuracy.
- **Case Studies:** Apply the framework to real-world environmental scenarios over specific time periods.

### Approach

1. **Data Acquisition:** Satellite data will be gathered from sources like NASA, ESA, or Google Earth Engine.
2. **Preprocessing:** Use OpenCV and NumPy for image enhancement and noise reduction.
3. **Change Detection:** Algorithms such as image differencing, thresholding, and machine learning-based classification will be used.
4. **Interface Development:** A GUI will be developed using Tkinter or PyQt to facilitate user interaction.
5. **Validation:** Detected changes will be compared with ground truth data for validation.
6. **Case Studies:** The developed approach will be demonstrated by analyzing selected regions for environmental changes.

### Technologies

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries/Frameworks:** OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Data Sources:** NASA, ESA, Google Earth Engine
